# Activity-1-Success-vs-Failure
# Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations
#b.1 Company Overview

Gaisano Mall is a well-known retail chain in the Philippines. The company decided to install an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to centralize its operations, improve how it manages its inventory, and provide better customer service. The company was growing very fast, and it needed a centralized system to manage its supply chain and sales data effectively.

#b.2 Implementation Process

The firm thoroughly studied its needs and involved the key stakeholders before starting the implementation. The firm chose a reputable ERP vendor that offered great post-installation support. Instead of installing everything at once, the firm installed the system in stages in order not to disrupt business operations dramatically. Employees were provided with exhaustive training and support to familiarize them with the new system. The firm also tracked the efficiency of the system and resolved issues as they arose.

1.3 Key Success Factors

There were reasons why the ERP system succeeded. The management of the company remained committed to the project and was well planned. The workers participated and were maintained through training exercises. There was good support provided by the vendor of the ERP system, with the vendor tailor-making the system to meet the needs of the company. Step-by-step roll-out of the system also worked to mitigate the risks involved. The firm kept monitoring and sustaining the system afterward.
